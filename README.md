Project Overview
In the realm of investment, achieving a balance between risk and returns is paramount. This project leverages the power of quantitative analysis to make informed decisions, using the Sharpe Ratio as a key metric for assessing risk-adjusted returns. By integrating SQL for efficient data handling and Python for sophisticated financial modeling, we aim to develop a robust framework for portfolio management that maximizes returns within acceptable risk levels.

Key Features:
Risk and Return Analysis: Utilize Python to calculate key financial metrics, including the portfolio's expected returns, volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio.
Data Management: Leverage SQL databases to manage and query financial data efficiently, ensuring quick access to stock prices, historical returns, and other relevant financial information.
Portfolio Optimization: Implement optimization algorithms in Python to find the optimal asset allocation that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, thereby achieving the best balance between risk and returns.
Technologies Used
SQL: For data storage, management, and retrieval, ensuring that large volumes of financial data are handled efficiently.
Python: For performing quantitative analysis, financial calculations, and data visualization. Key libraries used include Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing results.
